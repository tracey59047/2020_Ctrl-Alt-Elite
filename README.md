# Instructions on how to run

To run locally, use git to download the main branch to your computer. Navigate to the directory and make sure you have NPM installed https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm.

You will want to navigate to activity-tracker and back-end and run the command "npm i" from the terminal. Once everything is done, you can run the program(s).

To ensure the full functionality of the program, run "npm start" in the back-end directory first and then "npm start" in the activity-tracker directory.

If you get any errors from the back-end directory about port 9000 being in use, run "npx kill-port 9000". It sometimes does not recognize that a port is not running, so it will need to be cleared out of any remnants of activity.
